# NutshellCRM-lead-generator-with-form
An html form that uses a get method to creates a lead Object in NutshellCRM using the NutshellCRM API. 

This is a simple PHP project that includes a form that can easily be included [include('php_form.php')] anywhere in your site. The prject is based on and uses the NutshellApi.php file [ nutshell-api-php/NutshellApi.php ] with a custom lead creation function that allows variable input. 

Packages are contained in smaller modules which allows the editing of files much quicker and easier.

the /_data folder and /_data.php file must be renamed as /data/data.php, and your login-credentials, lead source, and lead assignee must be added to /data.php.
